    Hi, {{ $name }}!

    This email has been generated under the following conditions:
    <ul>
        <li> Using Laravel 5.7 </li>
        <li> Using gmail smtp (modify the env file with credentials) </li>
        <li> using a blade view </li>
    </ul>

    Now, if only if this would work with Email Verification (perhaps with mail queuing as well), that would be awesome.
