# ReactJSLaravelTutorial

## This is a test to play around with Laravel and ReactJS. <br><br>

Currently, this project has the following functionality: <br>
1) A ReactJS front-end loading in the welcome.blade.php view.
2) React-Router linking enabled, with Laravel route code to enable this

## To run this project

I am using Homestead. Once you have cloned this repository and configured your Homestead.yaml file to access it in both folders and sites, then in the project directory, use composer to install necessary Laravel dependencies. Then do this:

```npm install```
```npm run dev```

In your homestead directory 
```vagrant up --provision```

Access your site in a web browser
